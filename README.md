# Using-Altium-to-design-a-circuit
This circuit is intended to sense the differential current between two DC currents and has the same principle as the GFCI cricuit. 

This design is bulid to sense the difference between two DC currents in the 100mA  to  200mA range and measure differential currents in  the  range  of  10mA-50mA with an error less than 1mA. the circuit should sense  the  magnetic  field  form  two  coils  with  currents  flowing in the opposite direction. If the currents match exactly, the net field from the co-wound coil will be zero.
